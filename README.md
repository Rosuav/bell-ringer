Bell-Ringer
===========

or: "Shut up, StreamLabs"

Automatically silence the StreamLabs dashboard notifications. Will suppress the
number in the tab title, and hide the red number on the notifications button.
If you wish to see the actual notifs, they will still be there, waiting for you.
Note that the bell will still "shake", so if you deliberately choose to look at
it, you can see that there are notifications waiting for you (but it's not
distracting).

To update:
1. Bump the version number in the manifest
2. Run make to create/refresh the zip file
3. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/ and upload the new file.
